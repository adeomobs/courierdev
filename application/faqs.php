            <button class="accordion">How does Delux Courier work?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>All Delux Courier packages are first sent to one of our domestic regional shipping centers for international processing and bundling. At the Delux Courier shipping center, we print and apply an international shipping label and customs form using the information you provided. For Delux Courier Economy and Delux Courier Standard shipments, your package is then handed to a postal carrier, such as the USPS, and transported to its final destination. For Delux Courier Plus, shipments are also pre-advised electronically before transport so they clear customs in advance of arrival in the destination country.</p>

                <em>Please note:  Due to delays caused by COVID-19, your shipments may have stopped receiving tracking updates.  Rest assured, our partners are continuing to process and deliver packages; however, shipments may be delayed for 30 or more days. We have been seeing unusually large numbers of claims submitted after 30 or even 45 days of shipment being denied due to shipments still being in transit, in which case the shippers must resubmit those claims later. Therefore, we currently recommend waiting to submit a claim until 60 days of transit have occurred.</em>
