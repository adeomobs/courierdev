            <h3>FREE HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD</h3>
            <p>Transparent Hands Foundation US INC is a 501©(3) nonprofit organization registered in the USA. One of the largest crowdfunding platform in the healthcare sector of Pakistan. It offers a complete range of free healthcare services including medical and surgical treatments and free medical camps facilities to the underprivileged community of Pakistan.</p>
            <p>This online fundraising platform provides an online giving opportunity for donors from around the globe to donate online to needy patients in Pakistan while ensuring complete transparency. It also sets up free medical camps in the rural areas of Pakistan in which, free consultation, free medicines, free health awareness sessions, and free diagnostic tests facilities are also provided to deserving patients.</p>
            <h3>HEALTHCARE ISSUES IN PAKISTAN</h3>
            <p>More than 80 million people in Pakistan are living below the poverty line due to which they are unable to undergo proper health treatment if they suffer from any disease. The estimated number of surgery backlogs in Pakistan is in millions every year.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are not many health insurance plans for the underprivileged community due to which, the majority of the people are unable to undergo medical or surgical treatment. </li>
                <li>Beyond the cost of medical and surgical procedures, they have to pay for other expenses such as pre and post-operative expenses that include; medical tests, medications, and hospital stay charges. It is almost impossible for someone who earns less than $2 a day to pay a hefty amount for medical relief. </li>
                <li>There is a lack of medical facilities and medical professionals in rural areas across Pakistan due to which, poverty-stricken families are unable to avail required treatment. </li>
                <li>There are a limited number of beds in local hospitals which are not enough to cater to the healthcare needs of underprivileged communities in Pakistan. </li>
                <li>Every second patient including a child is put on a long waiting list for free treatment and during the waiting period, the patient’s health further deteriorates. In most cases, patients expire until their turn comes for free treatment in government hospitals.</li>
                <li>Private hospitals are out of the reach for lower-income class families due to the high costs of consultation fees and medical & surgical procedures. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>OUR IMPACT ON THE PAKISTANI COMMUNITY</h4>
